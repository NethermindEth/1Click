# 1click
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/NethermindEth/1click)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/NethermindEth/1click)

A one click setup tool for PoS network/chain validators. Currently, `1click` is designed mainly for solo stakers and testnets devs of Beacon Chain and The Merge (Ethereum). `1click` generates docker-compose scripts for the entire on-premise validator setup depending on the chosen client.

## üí• How this all started?

As people who actively work on The Merge, we know how hard it is to set up an Ethereum validator:
- The setup requires at least three nodes: an execution node (geth, nethermind, etc), a consensus node, and a validator node (lighthouse, prysm, etc)
- You then need to execute them, connect them, monitor them, and get the validator keys (which includes staking 32 ETH).
- There are several valid combinations of clients to choose for the setup. You need to go through the client's docs, evaluate the client, get instructions for it and test it. You also need to feel comfortable executing commands in the cli, know docker, and basic networking. On top of this, there are many different configurations you can use for your client node.
- In the case of working with Mainnet, you are working with real money that can potentially be lost in the event of having downtime or being slashed. To avoid losing real value, you must be aware of and follow best practices on the validator setup, and also monitor your nodes.
- Have you heard of MEV? Flashbots is working on an MEV-Boost component which will take your validator to another level of awesomeness. You most likely want to always be running the latest version, but you also most likely don‚Äôt have the time to understand MEV Boost architecture and how to successfully implement it into your environment.
  
> Enter 1click

We want `1click `to take care of all of this for you. With just a few clicks or steps, `1click` can create an entire staking architecture that supports client diversity and Ethereum's latest features, while being completely free and open source. We want `1click` to save you from mistakes in this complex setup; along with hours or days of research, reading and testing. We want you to be able to stake easily with or without blockchain knowledge by giving you the tools to help this amazing community (and earn some good money of course üòâ).

We want to share our knowledge in this topic and create something that allows everyone to easily and safely set up lots of validators. 

We don't want to stop at Ethereum. We also want to help stakers of other PoS networks/chains, so if your favourite chain is not here, you are more than welcome to contribute!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start

### Installation (Only UNIX systems)

#### Using Go

If you have at least `go1.18.0` installed then this command will install the `1click` executable along with the library and its dependencies:

```
go install github.com/NethermindEth/1click/cmd/1click@latest
```

The executable will be in `$GOBIN` (`$GOPATH/bin`) 

#### Manual

Generate the executable manually (need Go installed):

```
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/1click.git
cd 1click
go build -o 1click cmd/1click/main.go
```

or if you have `make` installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/1click.git
cd 1click
make compile
```

The executable will be in the `1click/build` folder

---
In case you want the binary in PATH (in case you don't have `$GOBIN` either in PATH), copy it to `/usr/local/bin`:

```
# Using go
sudo $GOPATH/bin/1click /usr/local/bin/
# Manual
sudo cp 1click/build/1click /usr/local/bin/
```

#### Download the binary (only for linux)

> This is temporary until the first release

Download directly the binary and put it in `/usr/local/bin`:

```
sudo curl -LJ -o /usr/local/bin/1click https://github.com/NethermindEth/1click/raw/main/build/1click
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/1click
```

### Dependencies
`1click` dependencies are `docker` and `docker-compose`, but if you don't have those installed, `1click` will show instructions to install them, or install them for you.

### Quick run
With `1click cli` you can go through the entire workflow setup:
1. Check dependencies
2. Generate a `docker-compose` script with randomized clients selection and `.env`
3. Execute the `docker-compose` script (only execution and consensus nodes will be executed by default)
  
## üî• What can you do right now with this tool?

- Select an execution, consensus and validator node (manually or automatically) and generate a `docker-compose` script with production tested configurations to run the setup as you want.
- Generate the keystore folder using the [staking-deposit-cli](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli) tool with `1click keys`
- Don't remember `docker-compose` commands or flags? No problem, you can check the logs of the running services of the generated `docker-compose` script with `1click logs` and shutdown the services with `1click down`

> The setup is currently designed to start all the three nodes required to start a validator (execution, consensus and validator node). This will change soon and `1click` will let you connect to a public or remote node, or to automatically start the validator node when the execution and consensus nodes in the setup are synced. Although you can do all of this after generating the docker-compose script üòâ
