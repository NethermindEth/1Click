# Validator Keystore

The validator keystore is a folder where all the validator keys lie. There you can found the validator signing key, with which the validator sign on-chain duties such as attestations and block proposals; the validator public key, which allows the network to identify and associate between the validator and the ETH funds; and the withdrawal key, which is required to move (or withdraw) the validator balance.
