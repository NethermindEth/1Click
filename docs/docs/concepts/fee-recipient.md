# Fee Recipient

:::tip

If you don't configure your fee recipient wallet address, your priority fee earnings will be deposited into a burn address.

:::

Fee Recipient is a feature that lets you specify a priority fee recipient address on your validator client instance and beacon node.

Your fee recipient wallet address is a standard Ethereum wallet address, just like the wallet address used when sending and receiving tokens from Metamask. Execution clients deposit priority fees into this address whenever your validator client proposes a new block.
