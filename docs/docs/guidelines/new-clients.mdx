# Adding new Clients

We can add new Consensus, Execution or Validator clients to Sedge, you will mostly only need to add a few config files
here and there.

## Adding a Consensus Client

While adding a Consensus Client, you should follow this steps:
1. Add a template under `templates/services/merge/consensus/` that contains all the docker compose parts for run that
new client.
2. Add what is going to be the environment vars for the docker compose file under each of the supported networks for this
new client, for example:
 - `templates/envs/[network]/consensus/new_client.tmpl`
3. Update the script that check for updates on the images at `scripts/check-image-updates.sh`.
4. Update documentation, including all the references on `docs/docs` folder, that are going to be displayed on Sedge
official documentation, and on the `Readme.md`
5. Add entry on the `CHANGELOG.md`

## Adding an Execution Client

You can follow as an example [this PR](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/pull/156), that adds Erigon to the
supported Execution Clients.

The most important things to add:
1. Add a template under `templates/services/merge/execution/` that contains all the docker compose parts for run that
new client.
2. Add what is going to be the environment vars for the docker compose file under each of the supported networks for this
new client, for example:
    - `templates/envs/[network]/execution/new_client.tmpl`

official documentation, and on the `Readme.md`
5. Add entry on the `CHANGELOG.md`
6. Run tests, and add new tests if needed.

## Adding a Validator Client

While adding a Validator Client, you should follow this steps:
1. Add a template under `templates/services/merge/validator/` that contains all the docker compose parts for run that
new client.
2. Ensure the template for the service import properly all the keystores in the right place, you should see the
`validator-import` in other templates.
3. Add what is going to be the environment vars for the docker compose file under each of the supported networks for this
new client, for example:
 - `templates/envs/[network]/validator/new_client.tmpl`.
4. Update the script that check for updates on the images at `scripts/check-image-updates.sh`.
