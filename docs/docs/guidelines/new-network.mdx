# Adding new Networks

We support Ethereum Mainnet and Gnosis Chain, and with the time we will update the different tesnet on those networks.

We support only active testnet, like Sepolia or Goerli for Ethereum and Chiado for Gnosis, and in the past we supported
other networks now deprecated, we will give our best to keep our pipeline updated.

If you want to contribute to Sedge adding a new network, you can follow the next steps:

1. Create a folder with the name of the network under `templates/envs`.
2. Create an envs base that contains network base information at `templates/envs/[network]/env_base.tmpl`, like in the
above example for sepolia:
```
{{/* docker-compose_base.tmpl */}}
{{ define "env" }}
# --- Global configuration ---
NETWORK=sepolia
TTD=17000000000000000
RELAY_URL=https://0x845bd072b7cd566f02faeb0a4033ce9399e42839ced64e8b2adcfc859ed1e8e1a5a293336a49feac6d9a5edb779be53a@builder-relay-sepolia.flashbots.net
{{template "execution" .}}
{{template "consensus" .}}
{{template "validator" .}}
{{ end }}
```
3. Add configs for each of the clients (consensus, execution, validator) in the respective folders inside
`templates/envs/[network]/[client]`.
4. Create an entry on `configs/init.go` with the network information, for example:
```
		"sepolia": {
			Name:               "sepolia",
			RequireJWT:         true,
			NetworkService:     "merge",
			GenesisForkVersion: "0x90000069",
		},
```
5. Update documentation, including all the references on `docs/docs` folder, that are going to be displayed on Sedge
official documentation, and on the `Readme.md`
6. Add entry on the `CHANGELOG.md`
