# Running by yourself

Once you use `sedge cli` to generate the docker-compose file, you can run it by yourself, but you will lose the ability
to use sedge cli to manage the cluster.

:::caution

Each time you execute `sedge cli` to generate the docker-compose file, that file and all modified files under the `docker-compose-scripts` will be overwritten.

:::

## Modify the environment variables

Once generated the docker-compose file, you can modify the environment variables in the `.env` file under the `docker-compose-scripts` directory.

After that, you can run the following command to start the cluster:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
