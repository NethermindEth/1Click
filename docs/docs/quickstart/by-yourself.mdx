# Control Your Setup Stack

Once you use `sedge cli` or `sedge generate` to generate the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can handle it by yourself. This guide will show you how.

There are several reasons why you would need to manage the setup after using Sedge for generating the setup files. You
might want to modify the `.env` or `docker-compose.yml` file to change the setup configuration, or simply copy these
files to another machine. Currently, Sedge runs the docker compose stack that was generated using `sedge run`. You
can use `sedge logs` and `sedge down` on any `docker-compose.yml`.

:::caution

Each time you execute `sedge cli` or `sedge generate` to generate the docker-compose file, that file and all modified
files under the `sedge-data` directory will be overwritten except the keystore folder.

:::

:::tip

You can point to a different generation path by using the `--path` option. This is useful if you want to generate the
files in a different directory, or if you want to generate multiple setups.

## Execute the setup

Once generated the docker-compose file, you can modify either the environment variables in the `.env` file or the
`docker-compose.yml` under the `sedge-data` directory.

After that, you can run the following command to start the setup from the `sedge-data` directory:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

or the following command from any directory assuming that you have the path to the `sedge-data` folder (let's call it `<path>`):

```bash
docker compose -f <path> up -d
```

## Stop the setup

To stop the setup, you can run the following command from the `sedge-data` directory:

```bash
docker compose down
```

or the following command from any directory assuming that you have the path to the `sedge-data` folder (let's call it `<path>`):

```bash
docker compose -f <path> down
```

## Check the container logs

The compose stack is made of several running docker containers. The setup for an Ethereum full node that Sedge applies consists of a container for each node (execution, consensus and validator node). You can run the following command to check the logs of a given container/node from the `sedge-data` directory:

```bash
docker compose logs <node>
```

> Replace `<node>` with the node type, e.g: execution, consensus, validator

or the following command from any directory assuming that you have the path to the `sedge-data` folder (let's call it `<path>`):

```bash
docker compose -f <path> logs <node>
```

Press `ctrl+c` or `control+c` to exit from the `docker compose logs` command.
