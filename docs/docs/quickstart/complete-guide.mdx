# Complete quickstart guide

Sedge is a one-click setup tool that you can use to set up and run a validator on Ethereum easily and without any prior knowledge. In this guide, you will go through every step in the validator setup using Sedge, along with detailed explanations for beginners.

This is a beginner-friendly guide. Familiarity with the command line is expected, but otherwise, this guide makes no assumptions about your technical skills or prior knowledge.

## Overview

We will walk through the following steps:

1. Download and install Sedge in a new brand machine
2. Generate validator keystore
3. Run Sedge's main workflow with default configuration values and use it to install dependencies (only for Linux)
4. Generate a `docker-compose` script with a randomized set of execution, consensus and validator clients
5. Run the `docker-compose` script

The hardware specifications of the machine we are going to use are:

- 4 CPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 200 SSD
- Ubuntu 22.04/amd64

### 1 Download and install Sedge in a new brand Linux machine

First open a console in the Home directory. Then use `curl` or `wget` to download a binary from the releases page
(we will be using the `1.0.o` version). Check the [installation guide](install-guide) for more information or if you
want to use another installation method:

<Tabs groupId="download-cmds">
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl">

  ```
  curl -L https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/releases/download/1.0.0/sedge-v1.0.0-linux-amd64 --output sedge
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="wget" label="wget">

  ```
  wget https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/releases/download/1.0.0/sedge-v1.0.0-linux-amd64 -O sedge
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::note

The `-O` flag is to rename binary as __sedge__

:::

:::note

The `$` symbol represents the Terminal prompt

:::

:::info

This guide assumes your Terminal session is pointing all the time to the folder in which you downloaded Sedge. You can
check the directory pointed by your Terminal session if you execute `pwd`.

:::

You can run `ls` to print the files and directories on the current directory and check the binary was downloaded correctly.

<!-- The following screenshot summarizes the above steps. Not important content was hidden so you can focus on the essential parts.

![download-and-ls](/img/download-sedge.png) -->

Set binary as executable executing `chmod +x sedge`. You shouldn't see any output or logs if the command was successful

**(Optional)** Run Sedge `./sedge --help` to check if the executable is ok. The `.` represents the current directory (where your terminal session is pointing to).

<!-- ![chmod-help](/img/chmod-and-help.png) -->

### 2 Run Sedge's main workflow with default configuration values


You can run Sedge's main workflow in two ways:
- Interactive mode
* `sedge cli` is a fully interactive command that will guide you through the process covering all the steps needed for the setup.
- Non-interactive mode
* The non-interactive mode is useful if you want to run Sedge in a CI/CD pipeline or if you are a more advanced user, and you want to run Sedge with a predefined configuration.

:::tip

If you are a new user, we recommend you to use the interactive mode.

:::


#### 2.1 1-click interactive setup

The `sedge cli` command will guide you through the process covering all the steps needed for the setup. It will be fully
interactive and will ask you for the required information. According to your selection, it will generate a `docker-compose`
and a `.env` wit the desired configuration.

:::info

You can learn more about `sedge cli` if you check [here in our documentation](/docs/commands/cli).

:::

#### 2.2 Non-interactive setup

If you want to run the non-interactive mode, you will need to run only two commands, and provide the set of arguments needed for each command.
1. `sedge generate`
2. `sedge keys`
3. `sedge import-key`
4. `sedge run`

##### 2.2.1 Generation

Running the `sedge generate` command will generate a `docker-compose` script and a `.env` file with a randomized set of
execution, consensus and validator clients unless set.

```bash
sedge generate full-node
```

You have other options to run `sedge generate`:
1. `sedge generate full-node` will generate a `docker-compose` script and a `.env` file with a randomized if not set,
execution, consensus and validator clients, with mev-boost if applicable unless explicitly not set. Validator node
can also be omitted if you use `--no-validator` flag.
2. `sedge generate execution` will generate a `docker-compose` script and a `.env` file with a randomized if not set
execution clients.
3. `sedge generate consensus` will generate a `docker-compose` script and a `.env` file with a randomized if not set
consensus clients.
4. `sedge generate validator` will generate a `docker-compose` script and a `.env` file with a randomized if not set
validator clients.
5. `sedge generate mev-boost` will generate a `docker-compose` script and a `.env` file with a mev-boost client.

:::info

You can learn more about `sedge generate` if you check [here in our documentation](/docs/commands/generate).

:::

##### 2.2.2 Generate validator keystore

Running the `sedge keys` command will generate a keystore folder with a validator keystore inside. This keystore will be used to register the validator.

```bash
sedge keys
```

:::info

You can learn more about `sedge keys` if you check [here in our documentation](/docs/commands/keys), and more about
[key management](/docs/quickstart/keys-management.mdx) .

:::

##### 2.2.3 Import Keys

Running the `sedge import-key` command will import the keys that you just generated in the previous steps.

```bash
sedge import-key
```

:::info

You can learn more about `sedge import-key` if you check [here in our documentation](/docs/commands/import-key), and more about
[key management](/docs/quickstart/keys-management.mdx) .

:::


##### 2.2.4 Running

Running the `sedge run` command will run the `docker-compose` script generated by the `sedge generate` command.

```bash
sedge run
```

:::info

You can learn more about `sedge run` if you check [here in our documentation](/docs/commands/run).

### Conclusions

Congratulations, you just installed and executed your first validator (and Ethereum full node) using Sedge. The only thing left is making the ETH deposit using the `deposit_data.json` you just generated and wait for the validator to be registered in the network.
