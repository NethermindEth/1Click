# Hardware requirements

Hardware requirements are continuously changing from time to time but we can give you an idea of what do you need. 

:::caution Warning

We assume you are using Sedge for the validator setup, so all of the nodes needed to run a validator (execution, consensus, and validator) will be installed and executed on a single machine. The requirements will be higher than if you run some of the nodes remotely, but this is a very secure and effective setup. Other setup methods involving a secure distribution of these nodes over different machines will be supported in the future.

Don't follow these recommendations if you don't plan to use Sedge for the validator setup.
