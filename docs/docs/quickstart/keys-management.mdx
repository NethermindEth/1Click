# Key Management

To become a validator on Ethereum PoS, an individual or entity needs to meet certain requirements, such as:

1. Holding a minimum of 32 ETH, which will be staked as collateral.
2. Running or participating in a validator client software (e.g., Prysm, Lighthouse, Teku).
3. Generating a validator key pair, which consists of a private key and a public key.

The validator's private key is crucial because it allows the validator to sign messages, propose new blocks, and attest
to the validity of other blocks. Importing the validator's private key into the client software is an essential step for
participating in Ethereum 2.0's PoS consensus mechanism.

When importing the private key, it's important to ensure the security of the key, as losing it or having it compromised
would result in potential loss of staked funds and control over the validator. Validators should follow best practices
for securely managing and storing their private keys.

## sedge keys

The `sedge keys` command is used to generate the validators keys, it will use a mnemonic that already exists or generate
a new random one. The same happens with the passphrase, if it is not provided, it will be generated randomly.

It can be used at any time, since that command does not require any generated file.

Once generated the keys, they can be imported using the `sedge import-key` command.


## sedge import-key

Import keys refers to the process of adding a validator's private key to a client software. The private key is imported
into the client software's keystore, which is a directory that stores the private keys of all validators that are
currently active on the network.

Import validator client keys, use the `--from` flag to specify the keys location,
and make sure that follows the [EIP-2335: BLS12-381 Keystore standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2335). This command
assumes that the validator client container exists, stopped or not.

This command stops the validator client during the importing process due to the
validator database being locked while it's running but leaves the validator client
in the same state in which it was found. That means if the validator is running/stopped
before the import, then the validator will be running/stopped after the command
is executed, regardless of whether the export fails or not. To force a different
behavior use `--start-validator` and `--stop-validator` flags.

## Slashing protection

Slashing protection is a mechanism in the Ethereum blockchain that is designed to prevent validators in the network from
being punished for unintentional mistakes that could potentially harm the network.

In the context of the Ethereum 2.0 network, validators are responsible for verifying transactions and creating new blocks.
Validators are required to put up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (in this case, ether) as a deposit in order to
participate in the network.

If a validator behaves maliciously or makes a mistake that harms the network, their deposit may be slashed, meaning that
a portion of their deposit is taken away as a penalty. This is intended to incentive validators to act in the best
interest of the network and to discourage malicious behavior.

However, in some cases, validators may be unfairly penalized if they experience technical issues, such as a network
outage or a hardware failure. Slashing protection mechanisms are designed to minimize the risk of these kinds of
unintentional mistakes resulting in a validator's deposit being slashed.

There are several mechanisms for slashing protection in Ethereum 2.0, including the use of redundancy and
backup systems, as well as penalties that are only applied in cases where there is clear evidence of malicious behavior.
These mechanisms are intended to encourage validators to participate in the network and to ensure that the network
remains secure and reliable.

### Slashing import

The `sedge slashing-import [flags] [validator]` command is used to import slashing protection data from a JSON file into the validator client.

The JSON file must be in the format specified by the [EIP-3076: Slashing Protection Interchange Format](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3076) standard.

This command assumes that the validator client container exists, stopped or not and that its database
is already initialized. The validator database is initialized if the validator is
running or has already run but is stopped, and also after importing the validator keys.

This command stops the validator client during the importing process due to the
validator database being locked while it's running but leaves the validator client
in the same state in which it was found. That means if the validator is running/stopped
before the import, then the validator will be running/stopped after the command
is executed, regardless of whether the export fails or not. To force a different
behavior use `--start-validator` and `--stop-validator` flags.

The `[validator]` is a required argument used to specify which validator client, from
all supported by Sedge (lighthouse, lodestar, prysm or teku), is used to import the
Slashing Protection data. This is necessary because each client has its own way to
achieve the importation.

Examples:
```
sedge slashing-import --from slashing-data.json prysm
sedge slashing-import --from slashing-data.json --stop-validator lodestar
sedge slashing-import --from slashing-data.json --start-validator lighthouse
```

### Slashing export

The `sedge slashing-export [flags] [validator]` command is used to export slashing protection data from the validator
client into a JSON file, following the [EIP-3076: Slashing Protection Interchange Format](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3076) standard.

This command assumes
that the validator client container exists, stopped or not and that its database
is already initialized. Take in mind that the validator client generates slashing
protection data after some time running, so for some clients export slashing protection
data just after start the client could produce some errors.

This command stops the validator client during the exporting process due to the
validator database being locked while it's running but leaves the validator client
in the same state in which it was found. That means if the validator is running/stopped
before the export, then the validator will be running/stopped after the command
is executed, regardless of whether the export fails or not. To force a different
behavior use `--start-validator` and `--stop-validator` flags.

The `[validator]` is a required argument used to specify which validator client, from
all supported by Sedge (lighthouse, lodestar, prysm or teku), is used to exporting
the Slashing Protection data. This is necessary because each client has its own way
to achieve the exportation.


Examples:
```
sedge slashing-export --out slashing-data.json prysm
sedge slashing-export --out slashing-data.json --stop-validator lodestar
sedge slashing-export --out slashing-data.json --start-validator lighthouse
```
