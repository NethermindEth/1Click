# Staking with Lido using Sedge

## What is the Lido Community Staking Module (CSM)?

The Lido Community Staking Module (CSM) is a protocol that allows anyone, especially community stakers and solo stakers,
to become a Lido Node Operator by providing an ETH-based bond as security collateral. CSM offers various benefits,
such as smoothed rewards, lower bond requirements, and a user-friendly experience.

Sedge supports the Lido CSM, allowing users to generate validator keys and set up their full nodes with ease. This guide
will walk you through the process of staking with Lido using Sedge.

## Generating Validator Keys with Sedge

To get started with CSM using Sedge, you first need to generate your validator keys. Sedge simplifies this process
with the `sedge keys` command, to generate keys compatible with Lido CSM, use the `--lido` flag:

```bash
sedge keys --lido
```

Once generated the keys, you can setup your full node:

```bash
sedge generate full-node --lido -n holesky

:::note

This command will generate a setup with the Lido Community Staking Module (CSM) enabled for the Holesky testnet.
You can set other networks by changing the `-n` flag, if supported.

:::

```
This command will generate a new set of validator keys with the following parameters:

- `withdrawal_address` set to the Lido Withdrawal Vault address
- `deposit_amount` set to 32 ETH
- `chain` set to the appropriate network (e.g., `holesky`, `mainnet`)
- `fee_recipient` set to the Lido Execution Layer Rewards Vault address
- `mev_relay` set to the designated MEV relays for Lido CSM on the appropriate network

## Configuring Your Node Operator

After generating your validator keys and setting up your node, you need to configure yourself as a node operator to
work with Lido CSM:

1. Upload the newly generated deposit data file pertaining to your CSM keystores onto the Lido CSM Widget
and provide the required bond amount in ETH, stETH, or wstETH. Before uploading, ensure that your nodes are synced,
running, and ready for validator activation.

2. Wait for your CSM validator keys to be deposited through the protocol and ensure your node remains online in the
meantime.

## Managing Your Node Operator

Once your validator keys are deposited and your node is running, you can manage your Node Operator using the Lido
CSM Widget. This interface allows you to:

- Claim bond and rewards
- Add extra bond amount
- Propose new Rewards and Manager addresses
- Add or remove validator keys

Remember to keep your node running smoothly and follow the Lido protocol rules to avoid any penalties or bond confiscation.

For more detailed information on managing your Node Operator, refer to the
