# Dependencies

Sedge requires only [Docker](https://www.docker.com) with the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) plugin to work.

### Using Sedge

In case you want to, Sedge can install the required dependencies using predefined [scripts](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/tree/main/templates/setup/linux/docker) (Only for Linux). Sedge will show you in every step what is going to execute. By default, a prompt will display the install instructions and will let you decide between installing the dependencies or exit and let you do it on your own. 

:::tip 

Use the `-i/--install` or `-y/--yes` flags to install dependencies without asking. (TODO: PUT LINK TO CONFIGURATION GUIDE)

:::

:::info

Sedge does a dependency check at the beginning of every command which require the use of the dependencies. If you have the dependencies installed on your machine, then Sedge will skip any prompt related to this topic.

### Using Docker official instructions

Check and follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Docker Desktop

[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is an easy-to-install application with a GUI that comes with Docker Engine and Docker Compose (what Sedge needs). Is available on Windows, MacOS and Linux. To install Docker Desktop follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

:::note 

You may notice that, for the Sedge's dependency installation feature on Linux, we are still using the classic Docker Engine setup along with the Compose plugin. This is because we found it more convenient for servers in the cloud. Also is still recommended to install docker using specific instructions for every Linux distribution. This may change in the future.
