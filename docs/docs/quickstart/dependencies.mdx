# Dependencies

Sedge requires only [Docker](https://www.docker.com) with the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) plugin to work.

## Checking dependencies

You can use `sedge deps check` to check if all the dependencies are installed and running.

```bash
sedge deps check
```

## Installing dependencies

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

### Using sedge deps install

If some of the dependencies are missing, you can install them using Sedge, provided you run the following command:

```
sedge deps install
```

With the above command, Sedge will install the required dependencies using predefined [scripts](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/tree/main/templates/setup/linux/docker).

Supported Linux flavours for dependency installation:

| OS             | Versions                   | Tested on last release |
| :------------: | :------------------------: | :--------------------: |
| Ubuntu         | 22.04, 21.10, 21.04, 20.04 | 22.04, 20.04           |
| Debian         | 11, 10, 9, 8               | 11, 10                 |
| Fedora         | 35, 34                     |   -                    |
| CentOS         | 8                          |   -                    |
| Arch           | -                          | -                      |
| Amazon Linux 2 | -                          | -                      |
| Alpine         | 3.15, 3.14, 3.14.3         |   -                    |

### Using Docker official instructions

Check and follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### Docker Desktop

[Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is an easy-to-install application with a GUI that comes with Docker Engine and Docker Compose (what Sedge needs). It is available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. To install Docker Desktop follow the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/).

:::note

We are still using the classic Docker Engine setup and the Compose plugin for Sedge's dependency installation feature on Linux. This is because we found it more convenient for servers in the cloud. Also, installing Docker using specific instructions for every Linux distribution is still recommended. This may change in the future.

    <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

For macOS, you need to install Docker Desktop. Follow installing instructions for Mac [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

:::info

Apple silicon chip (M1) is supported.

    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

For Windows, you need to install Docker Desktop. Follow installing instructions for Windows [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).

:::note

Ideally, it would be best if you had Docker Desktop with backend on WSL2. This is the recommended setup for Windows.
