# Setting up a Validator

By default, when you set up a full node, it will wait until:

1. The Consensus client to be up and synced.
2. Wait for 1 Epoch (using the `validator-blocker` service).

::note

You can set the number of epoch to wait using the flag `--wait-epoch int` on the generate command, the default value is 1.

:::

After that, the Validator will start to produce blocks.

## Restarting a Validator

If for any reason your setup is restarted, the `validator` will not start automatically. You will need to run it manually,
because otherwise, it will not wait until the `Consensus client` is up and synced, so, it might cause some slashing issues.

:::caution

The solutions to these problems, needs to be done manually for the user, and it is you don't do it, it can incur on penalties for your node.

:::

If docker daemon restarts (due to a machine reboot, for example), the docker compose services with a restart policy will
restart, but the depends_on policy won’t retake effect. The depends_on policy only takes effect after a docker compose
up (for the reboot case). This means the Validator can’t set a restart policy until we run down and up after a reboot
for it to now incur in any slashing.

### Solution

To solve this problem, we found two workarounds:
- Create a `systemd service`
- Create a `contrab job`

Both of those solutions will run after the reboot and will run the `docker compose up validator` command.

#### Systemd service

You can use the following steps to automatically run `docker-compose up` when your machine restarts:

1. Create a systemd service file with the following content:

```
[Unit]
Description=Docker Compose Service
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service

[Service]
Restart=always
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/docker-compose/file
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

Replace `/path/to/docker-compose/file` with the actual path to your `docker-compose.yml` file. You may also need to adjust the `ExecStart` path if your `docker-compose` binary is located elsewhere.

1. Save the file as `/etc/systemd/system/docker-compose.service`.
2. Reload the systemd daemon:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

```

3. Enable the service to start automatically at boot:

```
sudo systemctl enable docker-compose.service

```

4. Start the service:

```
sudo systemctl start docker-compose.service

```

5. After completing these steps, `docker-compose up` will automatically run when your machine restarts. You can check the status of the service with:

```
sudo systemctl status docker-compose.service

```

:::info

If you need to stop the service, you can use the following command:
```
sudo systemctl stop docker-compose.service
```

#### Crontab job

To create a cron job that automatically runs docker-compose up on system reboot, you should first create a shell script
that runs the necessary commands, and then set up a cron job to execute the script at system startup.

Here's how to do it:
1. Create a shell script:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your docker-compose.yml file is located. Then, create a new shell script file:

```bash
touch start-docker-compose.sh
```

2. Open the file with a text editor:
```bash
nano start-docker-compose.sh
```

3. Add the following content to the script:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Change to the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file
cd /path/to/your/docker-compose/directory

# Load environment variables, if any
source .env

# Start the Docker Compose services
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d
```

:::note
Replace /path/to/your/docker-compose/directory with the actual path of the directory containing your docker-compose.yml
file. Save and exit the text editor.
:::

3. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x start-docker-compose.sh
```

5. Set up a cron job:
Edit the system-wide crontab file:
```
sudo crontab -e
```

Add the following line at the end of the file:
```
@reboot /path/to/your/docker-compose/directory/start-docker-compose.sh
```

Replace /path/to/your/docker-compose/directory with the actual path of the directory containing your docker-compose.yml
file and start-docker-compose.sh script. Save and exit the text editor.

Now, the cron job will automatically run docker-compose up on system reboot.
