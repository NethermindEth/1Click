# Setting Checkpoint Sync

## Overview

Checkpoint sync, also known as "synchronization with checkpoints" or "checkpoint-based syncing," is a method of
synchronizing the blockchain by using predefined checkpoints in the blockchain. This approach is designed to
speed up the synchronization process and reduce the amount of data that needs to be downloaded, verified, and stored by
nodes.

In a traditional full sync, a node downloads and verifies every block and its associated transactions from the genesis
block (the first block in the blockchain) to the most recent block. This can be a slow and resource-intensive process,
especially as the blockchain grows in size over time.

In a checkpoint sync, nodes use predetermined checkpoints in the blockchain history. These checkpoints are block headers
that have been agreed upon by the Ethereum community as trustworthy and have been hardcoded into the client software.
When a node performs a checkpoint sync, it downloads and verifies the data starting from the most recent checkpoint,
rather than the genesis block. This significantly reduces the amount of data the node has to download and process,
making synchronization faster and more efficient.

It's important to note that checkpoint syncs rely on trust in the checkpoint data, which could be a potential point of
centralization. However, the checkpoints are generally chosen from well-known and verified block headers, reducing the
risk of a malicious checkpoint being introduced.

Checkpoint sync is one of several synchronization methods that Ethereum clients can use, including full sync, fast sync,
and snap sync. Each method offers a trade-off between speed, security, and resource usage.

## Setting Checkpoint Sync

Each network has set a default checkpoint sync url on Sedge. You can set the checkpoint sync url to a custom url using
the `--checkpoint-sync-url` flag. For example, to set the checkpoint sync url to `https://example.com/checkpoint.json`, run:

```
sedge generate full-node --checkpoint-sync-url https://example.com/checkpoint.json
```
