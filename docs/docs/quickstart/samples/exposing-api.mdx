# Exposing APIs

## Ethereum APIs

There are a few main options for connecting to Ethereum nodes:

- RPC (Remote Procedure Call) - The simplest option, just sends JSON RPC requests to a node. Used by web3.js and many other libs.
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication) - Local socket connection, higher performance than RPC. Also used by web3.js and others.
- WS (WebSockets) - For receiving real-time updates (new blocks, logs, etc). Also supported in web3.js.
- ETH (Devp2p) - Low level protocol to connect to nodes. Quite complex, not commonly used outside of core Ethereum implementations.

So in code, it would look something like this:
```
// RPC
const Web3 = require('web3')
const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:8545')

// IPC
const web3 = new Web3('/tmp/geth.ipc')

// WS
const web3WS = new Web3('ws://localhost:8546')

// ETH / Devp2p
// Much more complex, not shown here
```

You can then call methods on web3 to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, deploy contracts, send transactions, etc.
So to connect to both a consensus node (for mining/block info) and an execution node (for deploying contracts), you'd
simply instantiate multiple Web3 instances pointing to different nodes.

## Exposing APIs using Sedge

:::info

By default, Sedge doesn't expose any important port that can be used to interact with the node.
This is to prevent accidental exposure of the node to the internet.

:::

In order to connect to a node, you need to expose the ports of the nodes you are running that expose those APIs.


To expose the needed ports for APIs interactions in the generated docker-compose file, you will need to set the
`--map-all` flag while generating those files. This will expose all the ports of the nodes that expose APIs.

```
sedge generate full-node --map-all
```

:::caution

Exposing the ports of your node to the internet is a security risk.

Only expose the ports you need, and make sure to secure them properly.

:::

:::tip

If you run a docker image that use the same network of the setup, by default `sedge-network`, you can connect that container to the nodes you already have running. This way you can connect to the nodes without exposing the ports to the internet.
