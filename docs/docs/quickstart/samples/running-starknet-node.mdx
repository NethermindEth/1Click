# Running a Starknet node

## What is a Starknet node

You can run a node for the Starknet ecosystem which is a permissionless, zk-STARK-based Layer-2 network, 
aiming for full decentralization. The node utilizes Ethereumâ€™s Layer 1 for proof verification and data availability.

## Running a Starknet node using Sedge

Sedge can be used to run a Starknet node, running only one node, or alongside a full Ethereum node.

### Running a Starknet node alone

You can run a Starknet node alone, connecting to an external Ethereum-1 endpoint Relay url, or setting your own.
There is a example of how to generate a Starknet node using Sedge:

```
sedge generate starknet
```

### Running a starknet node alongside a full Ethereum node (execution + consensus)

If you generate a starknet node using Sedge, with the `--full` flag, Sedge will generate the node together with an Ethereum node 
and automatically connects to your locally running Ethereum (L1) node via a websocket connection without the need 
to provide an external Ethereum-1 endpoint node.

For example:

```
sedge generate starknet --full
```
