# Sepolia

The Sepolia testnet is a blockchain-based distributed test network that aims to provide users with a safe and secure environment
for testing and deploying decentralized applications (DApps).

It is an open source platform powered by Cosmos, a blockchain protocol that enables interoperability between different blockchains.
It enables developers to build, test and deploy DApps on a fully decentralized network.

The Sepolia testnet is a fast, secure, and reliable blockchain network. It is built on Tendermint, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus engine
that enables the network to reach consensus quickly and securely. It also features an optimized Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism,
which came in after September 2022â€™s Ethereum Merge. The Sepolia testnet was designed with scalability and security in mind.
It can process thousands of transactions per second and is capable of handling a large number of users.

## MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on sepolia by default, in case you want to remove it,
run `sedge cli` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge cli --network=sepolia --no-mev-boost=true
```

## Running a Full Node

For running a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge cli`. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --no-validator --network=sepolia
```

## Running a Validator

For running a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --network=sepolia
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys --network sepolia
```
