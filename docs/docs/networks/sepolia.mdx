# Sepolia

Sepolia is a permissioned Ethereum test network. Along Goerli, it is one of the testnets that is maintained after The Merge. The initial version of Sepolia used a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, in the light of The Merge, Sepolia followed the mainnet’s example and merged with the proof-of-stake (PoS) Sepolia Beacon Chain. So, Sepolia is now, just like Ethereum, a PoS chain. Furthermore, Sepolia is almost an identical copy of Ethereum, so it accurately mimics the mainnet and supports accurate testing. This enables developers to design, create, test, and track their project’s public performance before going live.

## MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on sepolia by default, in case you want to remove it,
run `sedge cli` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge cli --network=sepolia --no-mev-boost=true
```

## Running a Full Node

For running a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge cli`. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --no-validator --network=sepolia
```

## Running a Validator

For running a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --network=sepolia
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys --network sepolia
```
