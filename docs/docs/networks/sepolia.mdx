# Sepolia

Sepolia is a proof-of-work (PoW) testnet where dApp developers can test their applications. What differentiates Sepolia
from other Ethereum testnets is that most of its PoW validators are public validators. Combined with Sepolia being a
testnet, this creates the chance that validators will stop validating and the chain will fail to finalize,
making Sepolia one of the best testnets to see how decentralized applications will perform under the harshest conditions.

### MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on mainnet by default, in case you want to remove it,
run `sedge cli` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge cli --no-mev-boost=true
```

## Running a Full Node

For running a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge cli`. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --no-validator --network=sepolia
```

## Running a Validator

For running a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --network=sepolia
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys --network sepolia
```
