# Gnosis

Gnosis Chain is an EVM based Ethereum sidechain designed to be a platform for decentralized prediction markets.
It is a permissionless network governed by the Gnosis community.

## Run a Validator or Full Node

Validators and Full Nodes, protect the network by validating transactions and blocks. They are the backbone of the
network and are responsible for the security of the network. This guide shows you how to use Sedge to setup a
full node or a validator in Gnosis.

:::info

Validating the Gnosis Beacon Chain requires 1
[GNO](https://docs.gnosischain.com/about/tokens/gno) per validator process.

:::

### Generating a Full Node

To generate a setup of a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge generate full-node`. For example:

```bash
sedge generate full-node --no-validator --network=gnosis
```

### Running a Full Node with a Validator

To generate a setup of a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge generate full-node --network=gnosis
```

### Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys --network gnosis
```

### Running your setup

Once you have generated your setup, you can run it with the following command:

```
sedge run
```
