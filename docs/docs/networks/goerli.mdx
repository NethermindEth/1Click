# Goerli

Goerli is an Ethereum test network that allows for blockchain development testing before deployment on Mainnet, the
main Ethereum network. The test network was established in March 2019 with Proof-of-Authority. It used to use the Clique consensus
mechanism and was originally proposed by Chainsafe and Afri Schoedon. Goerli has successfully transitioned to
Proof-of-Stake following the networkâ€™s total block difficulty having crossed 10,079,000 on August 10th, 2022.

## MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on goerli by default, in case you want to remove it,
run `sedge generate full-node` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge generate full-node --network goerli --no-mev-boost=true
```

## Generating a Full Node

To generate a setup of a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge generate full-node`. For example:

```bash
sedge generate full-node --no-validator --network=goerli
```

## Generating a Full Node with a Validator

To generate a setup of a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge generate full-node --network=goerli
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys --network goerli
```

## Running your setup

Once you have generated your setup, you can run it with the following command:

```
sedge run
```
