# Goerli

Goerli is an Ethereum test network that allows for blockchain development testing before deployment on Mainnet, the
main Ethereum network. The test network was established in March 2019 with Proof-of-Authority. It used to use the Clique consensus
mechanism and was originally proposed by Chainsafe and Afri Schoedon. Goerli has successfully transitioned to
Proof-of-Stake following the networkâ€™s total block difficulty having crossed 10,079,000 on August 10th, 2022.

## MEV-Boost

We support [mev-boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost) on goerli by default, in case you want to remove it,
run `sedge cli` using the `--no-mev-boost` flag, for example:

```
sedge cli --network goerli --no-mev-boost=true
```

## Running a Full Node

For running a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge cli`. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --no-validator --network=goerli
```

## Running a Validator

For running a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --network=goerli
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys --network goerli
```
