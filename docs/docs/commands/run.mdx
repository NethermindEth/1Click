# Run

Running `sedge run` will allow you to run only one client.

## Help

```
$ sedge run -h
Initializing configuration
Run one node in a quick way. Provide only the command
options and the tool will do all the work.

Possible nodes to run: consensus, execution, validator.

First it will check if dependencies such as docker are installed on your machine
and provide instructions for installing them if they are not installed.

Second, it will generate docker-compose scripts to run a client according to your selection.

Finally, it will run the generated docker-compose script.

Usage:
  sedge run [flags]

Flags:
  -p, --path string                       docker-compose scripts generation path (default "./docker-compose-scripts")
      --checkpoint-sync-url string        Initial state endpoint (trusted synced consensus endpoint) for the consensus client to sync from a finalized checkpoint. Provide faster sync process for the consensus client and protect it from long-range attacks affored by Weak Subjetivity
  -n, --network string                    Target network. e.g. mainnet, goerli, sepolia, etc. (default "mainnet")
      --fee-recipient string              Suggested fee recipient. Is a 20-byte Ethereum address which the execution layer might choose to set as the coinbase and the recipient of other fees or rewards. There is no guarantee that an execution node will use the suggested fee recipient to collect fees, it may use any address it chooses. It is assumed that an honest execution node will use the suggested fee recipient, but users should note this trust assumption
      --node-type string                  Target node to run, select between consensus, execution or validator
      --node-value string                 Select the client you want to use in the node you are about to run. Example: 'sedge run --node-type execution --node-value nethermind'. Run 'sedge clients' for more details on each client according the network and type.
      --no-mev-boost                      Not use mev-boost if supported (default true)
  -m, --mev-boost-image string            Custom docker image to use for Mev Boost. Example: 'sedge cli --mev-boost-image flashbots/mev-boost:latest-portable'
      --jwt-secret-path string            Path to the JWT secret file
      --graffiti string                   Graffiti to be used by the validator
  -i, --install                           Install dependencies if not installed without asking
      --map-all                           Map all clients ports to host. Use with care. Useful to allow remote access to the clients
      --fallback-execution-urls strings   Fallback/backup execution endpoints for the consensus client. Not supported by Teku. Example: 'sedge cli -r --fallback-execution=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID,https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR-PROJECT-ID'
      --el-extra-flag stringArray         Additional flag to configure the execution client service in the generated docker-compose script. Example: 'sedge run --el-extra-flag "<flag1>=value1" --el-extra-flag "<flag2>=\"value2\""'
      --cl-extra-flag stringArray         Additional flag to configure the consensus client service in the generated docker-compose script. Example: 'sedge run --cl-extra-flag "<flag1>=value1" --cl-extra-flag "<flag2>=\"value2\""'
      --vl-extra-flag stringArray         Additional flag to configure the validator client service in the generated docker-compose script. Example: 'sedge run --vl-extra-flag "<flag1>=value1" --vl-extra-flag "<flag2>=\"value2\""'
      --logging string                    Docker logging driver used by all the services. Set 'none' to use the default docker logging driver. Possible values: [json none] (default "json")
  -h, --help                              help for run

Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.sedge.yaml)

```

## Execution Example

Running `sedge run` will perform similar to `sedge cli`, except that will a
