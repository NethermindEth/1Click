# Cli

`sedge cli` run the setup tool on-premise in a quick way.

## Help

```
$ sedge cli -h
Initializing configuration
Run the setup tool on-premise in a quick way. Provide only the command line
        options and the tool will do all the work.

        First it will check if dependencies such as docker are installed on your machine
        and provide instructions for installing them if they are not installed.

        Second, it will generate docker-compose scripts to run the full setup according to your selection.

        Finally, it will run the generated docker-compose script. Only execution and consensus clients will be executed by default.

Usage:
  sedge cli [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --consensus string                  Consensus engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
  -e, --execution string                  Execution engine client, e.g. geth, nethermind, besu, erigon. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
  -v, --validator string                  Validator engine client, e.g. teku, lodestar, prysm, lighthouse, Nimbus. Additionally, you can use this syntax '<CLIENT>:<DOCKER_IMAGE>' to override the docker image used for the client. If you want to use the default docker image, just use the client name
  -p, --path string                       docker-compose scripts generation path (default "./docker-compose-scripts")
      --checkpoint-sync-url string        Initial state endpoint (trusted synced consensus endpoint) for the consensus client to sync from a finalized checkpoint. Provide faster sync process for the consensus client and protect it from long-range attacks affored by Weak Subjetivity
  -n, --network string                    Target network. e.g. mainnet, goerli, sepolia, etc. (default "mainnet")
      --fee-recipient string              Suggested fee recipient. Is a 20-byte Ethereum address which the execution layer might choose to set as the coinbase and the recipient of other fees or rewards. There is no guarantee that an execution node will use the suggested fee recipient to collect fees, it may use any address it chooses. It is assumed that an honest execution node will use the suggested fee recipient, but users should note this trust assumption
      --no-mev-boost                      Not use mev-boost if supported
  -m, --mev-boost-image string            Custom docker image to use for Mev Boost. Example: 'sedge cli --mev-boost-image flashbots/mev-boost:latest-portable'
      --no-validator                      Exclude the validator from the full node setup. Designed for execution and consensus nodes setup without a validator node. Exclude also the validator from other flags. If set, mev-boost will not be used.
      --jwt-secret-path string            Path to the JWT secret file
      --graffiti string                   Graffiti to be used by the validator
  -i, --install                           Install dependencies if not installed without asking
  -r, --run                               Run the generated docker-compose scripts without asking
  -y, --yes                               Shortcut for 'sedge cli -r -i --run'. Run without prompts
      --map-all                           Map all clients ports to host. Use with care. Useful to allow remote access to the clients
      --run-clients strings               Run only the specified clients. Possible values: execution, consensus, validator, all, none. The 'all' and 'none' option must be used alone. Example: 'sedge cli -r --run-clients=consensus,validator' (default [execution,consensus])
      --fallback-execution-urls strings   Fallback/backup execution endpoints for the consensus client. Not supported by Teku. Example: 'sedge cli -r --fallback-execution=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID,https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/YOUR-PROJECT-ID'
      --el-extra-flag stringArray         Additional flag to configure the execution client service in the generated docker-compose script. Example: 'sedge cli --el-extra-flag "<flag1>=value1" --el-extra-flag "<flag2>=\"value2\""'
      --cl-extra-flag stringArray         Additional flag to configure the consensus client service in the generated docker-compose script. Example: 'sedge cli --cl-extra-flag "<flag1>=value1" --cl-extra-flag "<flag2>=\"value2\""'
      --vl-extra-flag stringArray         Additional flag to configure the validator client service in the generated docker-compose script. Example: 'sedge cli --vl-extra-flag "<flag1>=value1" --vl-extra-flag "<flag2>=\"value2\""'
      --logging string                    Docker logging driver used by all the services. Set 'none' to use the default docker logging driver. Possible values: [none json] (default "json")
  -h, --help                              help for cli

Global Flags:
      --config string   config file (default is $HOME/.sedge.yaml)
```
