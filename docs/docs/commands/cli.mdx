# Cli

`sedge cli` run the setup tool on an interactive mode.

## Help

```
$ sedge cli -h
This command will guide you through the process of setting up one of these node types:

- Full Node (execution + consensus + validator)
- Full Node without Validator (execution + consensus)
- Execution Node
- Consensus Node
- Validator Node

Follow the prompts to select the options you want for your node. At the end of the process, you will
be asked to run the generated setup or not. If you chose to run the setup, it will be executed for you
using docker compose command behind the scenes.

Usage:
  sedge cli [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for cli

Global Flags:
      --log-level string   Set Log Level, e.g panic, fatal, error, warn, warning, info, debug, trace (default "info")
```

## Execution Example

`cli` is Sedge's main command. This command takes care of the entire validator setup and is highly customizable. We will run it without flags and walk through the process:

- Initialization

```logs
$ ./sedge cli
# highlight-start
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] [Logger Init] Log level: info
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] You are running the latest version of sedge. Version:  v0.5.1
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [WARN] Execution client not provided. A random client will be selected. Random client: nethermind
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [WARN] Consensus and validator clients not provided. Selecting same pair of clients for consensus and validator clients using a random client. Random client: lighthouse
# highlight-end
```

:::info

The `logs` shown by Sedge in every step will be displayed and explained. You should compare your `logs` with the ones in this guide to check everything went as expected. Note that some logs are **highlighted**.

:::

As you can see, a configuration file was generated. This configuration file is generated with default values and we don't need to worry about it for this guide.

As we didn't specify the clients to be used in the setup, they were randomly chosen. Nethermind was chosen as the execution client and Lighthouse for the consensus layer.

- Check if dependencies are installed

```

<Tabs groupId="dependency-check">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="linux">

      If a dependency is missing, Sedge will print instructions to install it and a prompt will be shown to let you decide between letting Sedge install it for you or exit and installing it on your own. (Only for Linux)

      ```logs

      We will go with the `Install dependencies` option, but feel free to go with the `Exit` option, install dependencies on your own and then run Sedge again.

If dependencies were successfully installed, then you should see this log:
```

- Enter [fee recipient](/docs/concepts/fee-recipient) address

A new prompt will be shown for the fee recipient address. Although you can skip it by pressing enter, we don't recommend doing so.

✔ Please enter the Fee Recipient address. You can leave it blank and press enter (not recommended):

- Generate a `docker-compose` script with a randomized set of execution, consensus and validator clients

- Run the `docker-compose` script

Instructions on how to run the docker-compose script will be displayed and next to it is a confirmation prompt.

```logs
2022-XX-XX 00:00:00 -- [INFO] Instructions for running docker-compose script

docker compose -f docker-compose-scripts/docker-compose.yml up -d execution consensus

# highlight-next-line
? Run the script with the selected services execution, consensus? [Y/n]
```

Notice that it says "Run the script with the selected services **execution, consensus**?". This is because, by default, only these nodes will be up and running at the beginning, as they need to first sync with the network and this can take days.

> On some testnets the sync process takes hours depending on the network age and your internet bandwidth

Sedge will track the syncing progress of the execution and consensus nodes, and after they are completely synced, Sedge will automatically spin up the validator node. This gives you time to prepare the validator keystore (we will do that shortly) and to become familiar with the validator registration.

Now type `Y` or enter to start the following flow (You need to read carefully all the logs from now on):

:::info

Docker commands need to be executed with `sudo` by default, which requires root permissions and hence a **password prompt may arise**. Sedge only executes the commands that are shown in the logs, and you can also check the codebase to check that there's nothing nasty running under the hood. The codebase is public and fully visible on the Github repo.

Your setup is ready. You can run it anytime using the 'sedge run --path /root/sedge-data' command. Feel free to explore the files and make changes, although Sedge is not accountable for any misbehavior or issue caused by any modification done to the setup. Stay tuned for more updates and features!

Happy Sedging!
