# Introduction

**Sedge** is a one click setup tool for PoS network/chain validators and nodes written entirely in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/). Currently, **Sedge** is designed primarily for solo stakers and testnet devs of the Beacon Chain and the Merge (Ethereum), so these guides are focused only on Ethereum. **Sedge** takes care of the entire on-premise validator setup based on the chosen client; using generated docker-compose scripts based on the desired configuration.
